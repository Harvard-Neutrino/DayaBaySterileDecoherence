# AVERAGE OF FISSION FRACTIONS:
# -----------------------------
# This has been taken from Table IX (nueve) on 1607.05378.
# In principle this only applies to DayaBay, but we have assumed the same works for NEOS.
# It is important to keep this because we must use the same initial flux function for all reactors,
# in order for the nuissance parameters in our global fit to be reasonable.

# EFFICIENCY AND QUANTITY OF DETECTORS
# ------------------------------------
# We have used the same efficiency as in EH1 from DB.
# In principle, this is not important. Any change on this would be
# absorbed by a normalisation to the observed data.

# DISTANCE FROM REACTORS TO EXP. HALLS
# ------------------------------------
# NEOS only has one reactor and one detector.
# However, since they are very near, we cannot consider the detector puntual,
# and must integrate over its width. That's why we must consider its width.

# NEUTRINO COVARIANCE MATRIX

# Afterwards, we compute the covariance matrix taking into account this correlation,
# and normalising it to the systematic and statistical errors from figure 3(c) in 1610.05134.
# Covariance matrix is, therefore, not normalised to the total number of data, but to the ratio to DB.
# For more information on this, check NEOS.py, function get_total_covariance_matrix.
# Both matrices are in prompt energy.
neutrino_covariance_matrix = txt_to_array(dir+"NeutrinoCovMatrix.dat")

# The NeutrinoCorrelationMatrix.dat file contains a 61x61 table, the same number of bins
# as the total number of bins in NEOS. However, the digitalisation is far from perfect.
# The correlation matrix should have the maximum numbers in the diagonal.
# In order for this table to fulfill this property, we gotta trim it like [:-1,1:],
# thus having a 60x60 matrix (which is alright, because in our analysis we forget about NEOS last bin).
# The NeutrinoCovMatrix.dat file, which is build from this 60x60 matrix, is also 60x60.
# However, the NeutrinoCovMatrix.dat file has lost the possibility to include the last bin,
# because of an unmatch between the digitalisation of the matrix and the errors.
